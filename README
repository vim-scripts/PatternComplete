DESCRIPTION
This plugin offers completions that either use the last search pattern or
query for a regular expression, and then offer all matches for completion.
No completion base is used.

Without this plugin, you can just directly insert the contents of the last
search pattern register via CTRL-R /, but the register can contain \<word\>
boundary characters from a star search or other non-literal regexp atoms
like \V, .*, etc., which you usually don't want inserted into the text.

SEE ALSO
- Check out the CompleteHelper.vim plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

USAGE
CTRL-X /                The completion first queries for {pattern} (press
                        <Enter> to conclude), then finds matches for
                        {pattern}.

CTRL-X *                The completion first queries for {pattern} (press
                        <Enter> to conclude), then finds matches for
                        \<{pattern}\>, or {pattern} surrounded by whitespace
                        as a fallback.

CTRL-X &                Find matches for the last search pattern, quote/.

CTRL-R &                Insert first match for the last search pattern
                        quote/ into the command-line.
